# SQL Note

## Keys

- Primary Key
  - Unique for each row in the table
  - Cannot be `NULL`
- Surrogate key
  - Key that has no mapping to anything in the real world
  - E.g. student ID
- Natural key
  - Key that has a mapping or has a purpose in the real world
  - E.g. SSN
- Foreign key
  - Stores primary key of a row in another DB table
  - A way to define relationships between two tables
- Composite key
  - Key that needs two attributes to uniquely identify the row
  - Two primary keys



## What is SQL?

- Language used to interact with relational database management system (RDBMS)
- CRUD
- Hybrid language consists of four types
  - Data Query Language (Getting data)
  - Data Definition Language (Define schemas - types of tables, columns, etc.)
  - Data Control Language (Configure user/permissions)
  - Data Manipulation Language (Inserting, updating, deleting data)



### Datatypes in SQL

- INT - Whole numbers
- DECIMAL(M, N) - Decimal numbers - M = total digit of the number, N = total digit after the decimal point
- VARCHAR(l) - String of text of length l
- BLOB - Binary Large Object, Stores large data
- DATE - YYYY-MM-DD
- TIMESTAMP - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS



### Commands in SQL

- SQL Command capitalized for convenience

- CREATE DATABASE GIRAFFE

  - Creates database named GIRAFFE

- Create Table

  - Constraints

    - `NOT NULL` force the key to not be ```NULL```
    - `UNIQUE` force the key to be unique for each row of the table
    - `PRIMARY KEY` is just both `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`
    - `DEFAULT` can set a value if it's not defined by the user
    - `AUTO_INCREMENT` automatically incremented when the user add one in

  - ~~~sql
    CREATE TABLE student(
        student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
        major VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
    );
    ~~~

  -  ~~~sql
    CREATE TABLE student(
        student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(20),
        major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'NA',
        PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
    );
     ~~~

- Get Information about the table

  - ~~~sql
    DESCRIBE student;
    ~~~

- Delete Table

  - ~~~sql
    DROP TABLE student;
    ~~~

-  Edit Table

  - ~~~sql
    ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3, 2);
    ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;
    ~~~

- Inserting data
  - ~~~sql
    INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');
    INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(1, 'Jack');
    INSERT INTO student VALUES(NULL, NULL, NULL);
    ~~~

- Retrieve data

  - ~~~sql
    SELECT * FROM student;
    SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student ORDER BY name;
    SELECT name AS N, major AS M FROM student ORDER BY student_id DESC;
    SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY major, student_id;
    
    SELECT * FROM student ORDER LIMIT 2;
    SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY student_id DESC LIMIT 2;
    
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'Biology' OR name = 'Kate';
    -- <, >, <=, >=, =, <>, AND, OR
    
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE name IN ('Claire', 'Kate');
    ~~~

- Updating data

  - ```sql
    UPDATE student SET major = 'BIO' WHERE major = 'Biology';
    UPDATE student SET major = 'NA';
    ```

- Deleting data

  - ```sql
    DELETE FROM student WHERE student_id=5;
    ```



### More Complex Commands in SQL

#### Creating TABLE

Foreign Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch(
    branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(20),
    mgr_id VARCHAR(20),
    --- IF emp_id in employee table gets deleted, set mgr_id to NULL
    FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

Composite Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE works_with(
    emp_id INT,
    client_id INT,
    total_sales INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(emp_id, client_id),
    --- IF emp_id in employee table gets deleted, delete the row
    FOREIGN KEY(emp_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY(client_id) REFERENCES client(client_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Inserting DATA

For Foreign Key - Make sure you initially set to `NULL` when that row in the other table hasn't been created. Then Update the `NULL` to what it's supposed to be

#### Retrieving DATA

```sql
--- Gets different type of inputs in that column
SELECT DISTINCT sex FROM employee;
```

#### Functions

```sql
--- Count the number of entries that actually have values
SELECT COUNT(emp_id) FROM employee;

--- Average
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee;

--- Sum
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employee;

--- Group and process
SELECT COUNT(sex), sex FROM employee GROUP BY sex;
```

#### WildCards

```sql
--- % Any number of Characters
--- _ One character
SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';
```

#### UNION

```sql
--- Same number of columns is necessary and similar data types
SELECT first_name FROM employee UNION SELECT branch_name FROM branch;
```

#### JOINS

```sql
--- inner join
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name FROM employee JOIN branch on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id

--- left join (all rows on left gets included but
--- 			the right is included only when the condition is met)
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name FROM employee LEFT JOIN branch on employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id

---right join (vice versa of left join)

---full outter join (left and right join)
```

#### Nested Queries

```sql
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.lat_name FROM employee WHERE employee.emp_id in (
	SELECT works_with.emp_id FROM Works_With WHERE total_sales > 30000;
);
```

#### Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added new employee');
    END$$
DELIMITER ;

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger1 BEFORE INSERT ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES(NEW.first_name);
    END$$
DELIMITER ;

DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger2 BEFORE INSERT ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('new male');
		ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('new female');
		ELSE
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('new other');
        END IF;
    END$$
DELIMITER ;

-- Delete Triggers
DROP TRIGGER my_trigger
```

 

## ER Diagram

- Entity - Object we want to model and store information about
- Attributes - Specific information about the entity
  - Primary Key - Attribute(s) uniquely identify an entry in the table
  - Composite Attribute - Attribute that can be broken up into sub-attributes
  - Multi-valued Attribute - Attribute that can have more than one value
  - Derived Attribute - Attribute that can be derived from other attributes
- Multiple Entities - Can define multiple entity in the diagram
- Relationships - Define a relationship between two entity
  - Partial Participation - Some members participate in the relationship 
  - Total Participation - All members must participate in the relationship
  -  Relationship Attribute - Attribute about the relationship 
  -  Relationship Cardinality - The number of instances of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation
-  Weak Entity - Entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone (Depends on the existence of other entity) 
  - Identifying Relationship - Relationship that serves to uniquely identify the weak entity
